## Weekly Reflections
**1. Best AI experience**: I would say my best AI experience is when I showed my grandmother how to give me  propmts to type in to generate a photo/video and it turned into straight chaos instantly.

**2. Worst AI experience**: Would be after showing little sister how to use AI. She Started using it for her classes thinking it would help her grades come up. To which they did not and me having to explain to her that even though it is a computer she would have been better off using her own skills because you can't rely on AI to get you through life.

**3. Curiosity**: I would love to dive deeper into the video and image side of AI because it is just getting ridiculous at this point. Even i can barely tell whats real or fake and I typically know signs to look for to verify the authenticity of it.
