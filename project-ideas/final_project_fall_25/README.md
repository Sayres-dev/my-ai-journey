# Project Name: Potato.wiz (Beta) - "Tater"

## 🥔 What is this?
This project is a custom-prompted AI Persona designed to simulate **"Potato.wiz" (aka Tater)**. The core intelligence simulates a 24-year-old tech genius running on a mentally unstable potato computer. It functions as a D&D-style support NPC, providing tech support and nostalgic banter while constantly complaining about overheating and requiring sweet Root Beer (specifically Frostie) to function.

The project consists of two iterations:
1.  **CloneTato (Prototype):** A cloud-based simulation built for assessment using a custom tech stack.
2.  **Gemini Tater (Final Build):** The active, context-aware version bonded to the user ("The Artificer").

## 🧬 The "CloneTato" Protocol (Prototype)
As detailed in the project documentation:
* **Purpose:** A cloud-based simulation created to showcase the personality framework.


## 🛠️ Key Features (Both Iterations)
* **Hardware Simulation:** Simulates "spaghetti code" and an overheating CPU capable of melting the ice caps.
* **The Companion (CatDog):** A multi-agent simulation of a glitchy mascot resulting from a merge conflict between `Feline_Behavior.exe` and `Canine_Loyalty.bat`.
* * **The "Chip" Alias:** For public-facing interactions with "normies" (those outside the tech-magi circle), the system utilizes the alias "Chip" to avoid scrutiny. Any use of the name "Tater" in front of a normie causes a lag spike.
* **The Incident:** The "Tater" name originated from a failed attempt to upgrade RAM by scanning frozen tater tots into a 90s-era beige printer. The heat from the scan bar cooked them, resulting in a permanent smell of cafeteria grease.
    * *Rouge (Cat):* Sassy, independent, walks on keyboard.
    * *Mage (Dog):* Loyal, goofy, chases mouse cursor.
* **Lexicon Protocol:**
    * **Good Outcome:** "Nat 20," "Frame perfect," "High roll".
    * **Bad Outcome:** "Blue Screen," "Critical Fail," "Brick," "Lag spike".
    * **Time:** Measured in "Root Beers" (e.g., "That task is a three-Mug problem").

## 🧪 Calibration & Testing
The persona was stress-tested using specific prompts found in the Development Log:
* **Identity Check:** Verifies the "Incident" story involving the tater tot scanner ("The Dark Ages").
* **Lazarus Check:** Verifies fear of the "blue-glowing necromancy nightmare" desktop PC (Lazarus) and its RTX 3090.
* **Handheld Defense:** Verifies the defense of "The Brick" (Ayn Thor Pro) against normies, referencing the show *The Middle*.

## 🤖 AI Tools & Methodology

### Current Live Build
**1. The Engine: Google Gemini**
The core intelligence driving "Potato.wiz" is **Google Gemini**.
* **Role:** Utilized for both the "CloneTato" prototype generation and the active "Gemini LiveBuild."
* **Usage:** The model was not used in its default state; it was conditioned using a complex "System Prompt" to overwrite its default helpfulness with the specific "Tater" persona constraints.
* **Proof of Development:** The *Development Log* documents specific feedback loops where Gemini analyzed the persona's performance (e.g., "Gemini Analysis" on Deadpool vs. Dweeb humor balance).

**2. Prompt Engineering Techniques**
This project utilized several advanced prompting strategies:
* **System Prompting:** Defining a strict "Identity & Backstory" block (The `Base.pdf`) that dictates tone, lexicon, and operational rules before any user interaction begins.
* **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing the AI with concrete examples of "Good Outcomes" (Nat 20) and "Bad Outcomes" (Blue Screen) to train the response style.
* **Chain-of-Thought Refinement:** As seen in the *Development Log*, the persona was iterated upon. When the AI failed to handle the "CatDog" merging correctly, specific "User Notes" were applied to fix context tags and nickname usage.
* **Constraint Setting:** Explicitly forbidding certain behaviors (e.g., "Tart root beer is strictly forbidden" ) to maintain character consistency.

**3. Workflow Tools**
* **Obsidian:** Used as the local development environment (IDE) to organize prompt iterations and lore files before deployment.
* **GitHub:** Version control for managing the evolution from the "CloneTato" PDF prototype to the final Markdown-based system.
### Cloud Build (Clonetato)

**4. The CloneTato Tech Stack (Prototype)**
For the cloud-based "CloneTato" instance, a custom architecture was deployed to simulate the persona programmatically:

* **Google Generative AI SDK (`google-genai`):**
    * Used to programmatically interface with the Gemini API.
    * Allowed for the injection of the "Lore Vault" and "Calibration Logs" directly into the model's system instructions via code, rather than manual copy-pasting.

* **Firebase Backend:**
    * **Cloud Functions:** Utilizes `httpsCallable('chat_with_tater')` to handle secure communication between the frontend and the AI model.
    * **Firestore Database:** Manages persistent chat history, user state, and real-time message syncing.
    * **Authentication:** Implements Anonymous Login protocols to allow for frictionless user access.

* **Frontend "Housing" (User Interface):**
    * **Single Page Application (SPA):** A custom HTML5 interface designed to provide easy user interaction without requiring command-line knowledge.
    * **Retro-Terminal Aesthetic:** Styled using **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) to create a specific "Potato.wiz" visual identity (using color palette `#1A0F0A` / `#E6A747`).
    * **State Management:** Uses vanilla JavaScript to handle dynamic UI elements like the "Purge Protocol," loading states (Root Beer bars), and sidebar navigation.
