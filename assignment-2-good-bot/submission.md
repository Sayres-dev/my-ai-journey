## Summary

**Bot Name:** Glitch Pa

**Single Change Made:** I added a structural constraint forcing the bot to misinterpret the user request before replying with chaos.

**Success Rate:** 3/3 tests improved (All three demonstrated more structural cohesion and predictable satire).

**Best Unintended Consequence:** The bot's responses became much longer and more verbose due to the new mandatory two-step process.
