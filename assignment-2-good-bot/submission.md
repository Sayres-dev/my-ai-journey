## Summary
[cite_start]**Bot Name:** Glitch Pa [cite: 116]
[cite_start]**Single Change Made:** I added a structural constraint forcing the bot to misinterpret the user request before replying with chaos. [cite: 117]
[cite_start]**Success Rate:** $3/3$ tests improved (All three demonstrated more structural cohesion). [cite: 118]
[cite_start]**Best Unintended Consequence:** The bot's responses became much longer and more verbose due to the mandatory two-step process. [cite: 119]
