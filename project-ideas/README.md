# Project Ideation for Sarah Ayres

## Idea 1: AI-Powered Emulator Settings Advisor
**Problem/Goal:**
Finding the optimal settings (graphics, performance, controls) for a specific game on an emulator can be very time-consuming . This project aims to create an AI assistant that can recommend the best settings based on a user's hardware and the specific game.
**AI Tool(s):**
A custom Gemini Gem or a research-focused tool like Perplexity .
**Why This Interests Me:**
This directly solves a common frustration in the emulation hobby . It combines my interest in getting emulators to run perfectly with a practical AI tool that would save me (and others) a lot of time.
**Rough Scope:**
1-2 weeks . This would mostly involve training a Gem on community guides, wikis, and Reddit threads, then testing its recommendations.

## Idea 2: AI-Assisted Front-End Builder and Content Generator
**Problem/Goal:**
Building a custom emulation front-end involves repetitive coding, and populating it with high-quality metadata (like boxart and descriptions) is tedious . This project aims to use AI as a co-developer to help write the front-end's code, assist in creating a web scraper for boxart, and use an API to generate unique, engaging game descriptions.
**AI Tool(s):**
* **Coding:** GitHub Copilot or Gemini/ChatGPT to assist in generating the Python or HTML/CSS/JS code.
* **Content:** Gemini API or OpenAI API to generate game descriptions.
* **Scraping:** Using an AI tool to help write and debug a Python web-scraping script to find and download boxart.
**Why This Interests Me:**
This project directly combines all my interests: it involves creating a custom front-end, the "modding" aspect of writing scripts to fetch content, and uses AI as both a coding partner and a creative content writer .
**Rough Scope:**
3-4 weeks . This is a more ambitious project that involves learning to use an API, writing scripts, and integrating the components, similar in scope to the "Custom Chatbot" example .

## Idea 3: AI-Powered Native Console Modding Advisor
**Problem/Goal:**
Modding native consoles (like a 3DS, PS Vita, etc.) involves complex, multi-step guides and software that can conflict, and finding correct information can be difficult . This project aims to create an AI assistant trained on trusted community guides and forums to answer specific questions about mod compatibility and troubleshooting.
**AI Tool(s):**
A custom **Gemini Gem** or **Perplexity** , trained by feeding it text from specific, trusted modding guides (e.g., wikis, key forum threads) .
**Why This Interests Me:**
Information for native console modding is often scattered, and a mistake can be risky . An AI that acts as an "expert" by synthesizing information only from trusted guides would be a powerful and safe tool for me and others in the hobby .
**Rough Scope:**
2-3 weeks . The work would involve curating the training data (the guides), building the custom AI assistant, and then testing it with realistic, complex questions .
